Over the last two decades data has become increasingly accessible and visualization tools have continued to improve. At this point, we have more data than we know what to do with, and visualization tools so gorgeous that they are more art form than data communication.

For the last two years I've explored my own interests via data, with no place to consolidate the work. I'm now carving out that space for myself, and hopefully others. *Just Some Data* explores everyday questions with two primary purposes in mind:

* A place where authors share things they learn about the world.
* A place where authors share data visualization tools they're learning.

Hopefully, the space also serves as a source of interesting content.
